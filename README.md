**Star Class**
The start of the project I wanted to do a Halo HUD. I worked on the starfield at first after seeing a few of the previous students assignments we were shown in class. I wanted to create a hyperspace sound when traveling through the dimension, as you 
move the mouse across screen to the right the stars speed up giving you the feeling of travelling at high speed through space. Moving back across from right to left slows right down almost creating a stuck in time feeling as everything stops. The star class is made up of an array of size 800 which randomly creates the stars at different locations each frame rate at an angle that gives you a feeling of hurtling through space towards the planets.
